# Customer & Sales Analytics Using SQL


## üóÉÔ∏è Data Preparation and Cleaning ‚Äì SQL Walkthrough

This section contains SQL scripts used to clean and explore the **DataWarehouseAnalytics** database, preparing it for deeper analysis.

---

## üîß Setup and SQL Mode Adjustment

```sql
USE DataWarehouseAnalytics;
SET SESSION sql_mode = (SELECT REPLACE(@@sql_mode, "ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY", ""));
```
**Explanation:**
- Selects the working database.
- Disables `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` mode to allow more flexible use of `GROUP BY`, especially useful when not all selected columns are aggregated.

---

## üåç Explore Customer Locations

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT (country)
FROM customers;
```
**Purpose:**  
Fetches all unique countries where customers are located.

---

## üß© Explore Product Hierarchy

SELECT DISTINCT (category), subcategory, product_name
FROM products
ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;
```
**Purpose:**  
Shows all combinations of **categories, subcategories, and product names** to understand the product structure.

## üßπ Data Cleaning with Transactions

### üîÑ Clean and Format `birthdate` in customers

```sql

START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE customers 
SET birthdate = '1928-12-07'
WHERE birthdate = '';

UPDATE customers 
SET birthdate = STR_TO_DATE(birthdate, '%Y-%m-%d');

SELECT * FROM customers;
COMMIT;
```
**Explanation:**
- Disables safe update mode to allow unrestricted updates.
- Replaces empty birthdates with a placeholder date.
- Converts birthdate values to proper **DATE format**.
- Uses transactions to ensure updates can be rolled back if needed.

---

### üìÖ Format `create_date` in customers

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE customers 
SET create_date = STR_TO_DATE(create_date, '%Y-%m-%d');

COMMIT;
```
**Purpose:**  
Cleans and converts **product start_date** into proper date format.

---

## üì¶ Clean and Set Order Dates in sales

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE sales 
SET order_date = DATE_SUB(shipping_date, INTERVAL 7 DAY);

UPDATE sales 
SET 
    order_date = STR_TO_DATE(order_date, '%Y-%m-%d'),
    shipping_date = STR_TO_DATE(shipping_date, '%Y-%m-%d'),
    due_date = STR_TO_DATE(due_date, '%Y-%m-%d');

COMMIT;
```
**Purpose:**  
- Sets `order_date` to **7 days before shipping_date** as a placeholder if missing.
- Ensures all date fields are correctly formatted.
